# Monster Racers data

This is a collection of data pertaining to the Nintendo DS video game, *Monster Racers*, developed by KOEI Co., Ltd. and released in 2009-10. 

The data is used by [monracer.net](https://monracer.net/). It is maintained by its creator, [Lachde](https://github.com/Lachde), who also runs monracer.net. 

In future, it may also include parsing scripts to JSON. The raw data is presented as CSV. 

## Installation

To get the data, simply clone the repository using Git. 

```
git clone https://github.com/Lachde/monster-racers-data.git
```

## About the data

All data in the repo is sourced from the real game files and presented as CSV. Names for the columns were decided by the creator of the project, not sourced from the game itself. Some (less relevant) columns of data that exist in the game files have been excluded from this repository. 

Some data has also been modified from how it appears in the original files. For example, enemy with ID 138 is attached to the racer 'Masani' according to the original files; but, in fact, this is the exact monster used by 'Misaki' in the Superstar GP rematch, and no racer named 'Masani' exists. The data is modified to reflect this and other in-game features. 

Height and weight data is also modified to use metric units, sourced from the Japanese version of the game.
